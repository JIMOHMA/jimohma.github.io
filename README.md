## My Personal Website.

This is the latest version of my website.
The base is an open-source Jekyll theme, which has been modified, adapted and incorporated with JQuery and Node.js for some simplistic beauty.

You can use <kbd>Option</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> to stop the server.
You can use <kbd>--incremental</kbd> to reload the server and reflect your developmental changes dynamically 

Check out the Jekyll installation page for more information on how to get started. You might face a few issues with the Gemfile if you're trying to clone this website, what I recommend is to download any Jekyll layout/theme and manually move over all your static HTML/CSS code while following the appropriate Jekyll structure.

The website is currently not fully complete. It breaks on screens smaller than 900 pixels wide, I'm currently working on making it work on every screen size!

## Cheers!

Note: Built using Jekyll, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3
